# An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management

## Notable ideas

### Organizational design

**Keep innovation and maintenance together**. It is commonly seen that a new team
is spun up to innovate with "exciting" ideas while existing teams have to maintain
"boring" old systems. This inevitably demoralizes existing teams and perhaps
even tiered class of innovators and maintainers.

### The four states of teams

1. Falling behind
2. Treading water
3. Repaying debt
4. Innovating

Teams transitions to a new state exclusively by applying appropriate **system solution**
for the current state; tactical fixes don't address the problems at the root level.

### Design systems for one order of magnitude of scaling

**Systems normally survive one magnitude of growth.**

And that's why refactoring, migrations, or even rewrites are often required and
present in almost every single project. It can be frustrating having to work on
such projects once in a while. But after understanding the nature of it, it is
easier to accept the fact and embrace them.

Moreover, when a refactoring is required, it is often a good sign that the system
has grown in scale, whether by the growth of the product or the user base, such
that the value of such refactoring is justified and aligned with business needs.
