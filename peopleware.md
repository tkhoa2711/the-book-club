# Peopleware, 2nd edition

Author: Tom DeMarco & Timothy Lister

## Summary

One of the few books that I would personally call "enlightening". The other book
is Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. That book is for programming,
this book is for people and teams.

The book discusses all human aspect in the workplace: people management, team
productivity, hiring and culture. Unlike The Mythical Man-Month, I find this book
more fun and easier to read. The examples are resonating with what I've personally
experienced.

I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in any kind of leadership,
even if just to understanding the human side of it. It will make you at least an
understanding team member, at best an awesome leader.

## The sin of status meetings

Arguably one of the best chapters in the book. I've experience meetings that
every engineer despises; meetings that should be useful but somehow always feel
boring and unnecessary.

Tha author enlightens me by pointing out these "status meetings" are not for
"work status" as the name suggests. They are for the boss to assert their status.
They are "ceremonies".

Why they can be done differently in a more efficient manner: the information,
can actually be done asynchronously without everyone has to be present at the
same time.

> A real work meeting ... when there is a real reason ... all the people to think
> through some matter together.

As a result, such meeting should be ad hoc, most of the time.

Having said that, there is a need for ceremonies at organisation level. For example,
appreciation and welcoming new members.

## What great managers do best

> Making of community.

There's been voices against the ideas of creating a family environment in the
workplace. Here the authors use the word "community". While they share a lot in
common, especially the sense of belonging factor, they are not essentially the
same.

How do they do it. It's an art. There is no formula. It takes a lot of talent,
**courage and creativity**. The last two are the most important, in my humble
opinion.
